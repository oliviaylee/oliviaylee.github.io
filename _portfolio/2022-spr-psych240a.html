Our team proposed Model Predictive Curiosity (MPCu), a framework that backpropagates on curiosity values predicted by a forward dynamics model to select curiosity-maximizing actions.
We demonstrated the capability of MPCu to optimize for high-curiosity action values and enrich multi-object interactions in Box2D environment.
