   <sub> *Final report, poster, and code for Stanford's CS 224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Winter 2023)*<br>
    I finetuned GPT-2 and RoBERTa to predict word embeddings for novel lexical items given their definitions. The model was finetuned via supervised learning on word embeddings for lexical items in a regular dictionary, using embeddings from the pretrained models off-the-shelf as ground-truth embeddings. The resultant model as used to predict word embeddings for Urban Dictionary words given their definitions. </sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final report and poster for Stanford's PSYCH 240A: Curiosity in Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2022)*<br>
  We proposed Model Predictive Curiosity (MPCu), a framework that backpropagates on curiosity values predicted by a forward dynamics model to select curiosity-maximizing actions.
  We demonstrated the capability of MPCu to optimize for high-curiosity action values and enrich multi-object interactions in Box2D environment.</sub> <br>

  We trained an automatic speech recognition engine contextualized to Singaporean accents and terminology, which we incorporated into a mobile app to help consumers navigate local supermarkets with verbal queries. During testing, we combined the mobile app with a lattice formation of bluetooth low-energy sensors in a convenience store, which identified the user's position relative to the intended item, then generated and displayed the shortest path.</sub> <br>

<span style="color:#52ADC8">**Consciousness, Phenomenality, and the Representational Layer**</span> [\[paper\]](/files/2023-win-symsys202-paper.pdf){:target="_blank"} <br>
  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's SYMSYS 202: Theories of Consciousness (Winter 2023)*<br>
  I propose that metacognition on top of the representational layer, beyond mere possession of representational states, is critical for consciousness. I also distinguish between lower-level sensory states used only as intermediates in perceptual processing (e.g., edge detection, shape from shading), and higher-level sensory states (outputs of perceptual processing), and explore the introduction of phenomenality in this process. I finally discuss the implications of the above proposals for the functional and evolutionary roles of consciousness.</sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's SYMSYS 205: The Philosophy and Science of Perception (Spring 2022)*<br>
  I argue for the plausibility of the predictive processing framework over the standard bottom-up 
  model of perception, especially in the context of efficiently processing high-dimensional 
  multimodal inputs, where the qualitative space of each modality has unique dimensionality and structure.</sub> <br>

<span style="color:#52ADC8">**Large Language Models: Intelligence, Understanding, and Intentionality**</span> [\[paper\]](/files/2021-fall-symsys207-paper.pdf){:target="_blank"} <br>
  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's SYMSYS 207: Conceptual Issues in Cognitive Neuroscience (Fall 2021)*<br>
  I argue that modern large language models (LLMs) cannot achieve strong intelligence. LLMs do not learn quickly and flexibly, 
  nor do they employ heuristics for inference-making in a manner that an intelligent system would. Furthermore, LLMs have 
  limited capacity for understanding beyond symbol manipulation, and are purely reactional systems that lack intentionality.

  <sub style="font-size:11px">Author's Note (March 2023): This paper was written before the release of ChatGPT and GPT-4 (or GPT-x, depending on how far in the future you're reading this), and in hindsight, I acknowledge this paper perhaps does not give sufficient credit to the impressive emergent behaviors observed in LLMs. However, my general stance towards (purely language-based) LLMs are still largely aligned with this paper, and another more recent work that articulates views I am sympathetic to is [Shanahan (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03551.pdf){:target="_blank"}. That said, there are many cool developments expanding upon LLMs (like vision-language models, or grounded language models more generally) that I'm excited about! </sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final report for Stanford Existential Risk Initiative's AI research program (Spring 2021)*<br>
  I propose a protocol encompassing safety benchmarking services for CAIS systems, ranging from pre-deployment safety
  benchmarks that are applied during model training (transparency tools, systems enabling robust and safe exploration, 
  and performance when subject to adversarial policies) to post-deployment safety benchmarks that are applied during
  model application (monitoring systems and trip wires to ensure agent behavior is within safety standards and expectations).</sub> <br>

<span style="color:#52ADC8">**The Future of Human-Machine Interaction: Keeping Humans in the Loop**</span> [\[paper\]](/files/2022-fall-ospoxfrd29-paper.pdf){:target="_blank"} <br>
  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's OSPOXFRD 29: Artificial Intelligence & Society (Fall 2022)* <br>
  The doomsday ending that humans will be demolished in the fierce intelligence competition with AI systems, while remarkably enduring, is a narrow view that distracts us from active measures that can be taken in the present day. I assert that a key tenet of AI development going forward should be keeping humans in the loop. Distinguishing between non-immediate decision making (e.g., data analytics and robotics) and time-sensitive, safety-critical decision making (e.g., autonomous vehicles and aircraft) is key to understanding how to best facilitate human-AI collaboration in each case. I also evaluate three technical research areas that facilitate human-in-the-loop AI development and deployment.</sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's HISTORY 44Q: Gendered Innovations in Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Environment (Fall 2021)<br>
  Published in peer-reviewed journal, Embodied: The Stanford Undergraduate Journal of Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies*<br>
  I explore virtual reality (VR) software applications that contain discriminatory content and promote harassment behaviors towards historically underrepresented communities, and
  identify innovation processes to reframe VR applications so that they promote gender and social equality. I also explore design choices in VR hardware that tend to exclude females. 
  To address this, I propose a better sex balance in research participants is needed to rethink reference models for VR hardware, leading to more sex-sensitive VR headsets.</sub> <br>
