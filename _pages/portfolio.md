More on my personal background: I am a U.S. citizen who grew up and was educated in Singapore. Besides research, I worked as a software engineer at Salesforce and at several startups, ranging from deep tech (quantum computing) to B2C companies based in Southeast Asia and the United States. I also studied abroad at the University of Oxford (Magdalen College) in Fall 2022, where I studied graph representation learning and philosophy of mind, and tried my hand at rowing! I enjoy playing tennis, hiking, reading (+ occasionally writing) science fiction, and brush calligraphy.

Inspired by my interdisciplinary coursework, I am drawn to research leveraging cognitive science for robot learning and visual understanding. I aim to better understand human cognitive processes, such as multimodal perception, curiosity, and interactive learning, to develop human-inspired learning algorithms for robotics.

Below is an assortment of works that summarize my academic interests.

  <sub> *Undergraduate Honors Thesis*<br>
  Humans are capable of adapting to novel environments quickly using prior knowledge from past experiences. We can identify new instantiations of previously encountered object classes and easily apply previously learned skills to these new objects, both of which current embodied AI agents struggle with. Online reinforcement learning, where a robotic agent learns a mapping from states to actions to maximize a reward signal, provides a potential solution by enabling robots to learn from trial-and-error. However, current methods are sample-inefficient, lack shaping rewards, and require frequent resets. We propose a method to address the lack of shaping rewards using affordances, the action potential of objects, to create a dense shaping reward for online reinforcement learning. We leverage state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to predict keypoint-based affordance representations, which we use as intermediate dense rewards for online reinforcement learning, in addition to sparse task completion rewards. We demonstrate that dense shaping rewards speed up online reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation, and enables robots to succeed on a variety of object manipulation tasks, informed by human interaction priors encoded in VLMs. </sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's PHIL 186: Philosophy of Mind (Spring 2023)*<br>
  I argue that explaining the potency of phenomenal illusions is the crucial missing piece for a sound illusionist theory. I present two main desiderata for a positive theory of illusionism by drawing connections to related theories of consciousness, namely global workspace theory (Dennett, 2001) and Buddhist philosophy. </sub> <br>
  <!-- I address the question of why illusionism, the view that phenomenal characteristics of mental states are illusory, is so hard to stomach. Beyond explaining how the illusion of phenomenality arises, a robust theory of illusionism must adequately explain the incredible strength of the illusion and the difficulty of freeing oneself from the grip of this enduring intuition. Frankish (2016) attempts to address the former but not the latter, and I argue that explaining the potency of phenomenal illusions is the crucial missing piece for a sound illusionist theory.

In hindsight, I acknowledge this paper does not give sufficient credit to the impressive emergent behaviors observed in LLMs. However, my stance towards purely language-based models are still generally aligned with this paper. Another work that articulates views I am sympathetic to is [Shanahan (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03551.pdf){:target="_blank"}. That said, there are many cool developments expanding on LLMs (like vision-language models, or grounded language models more generally) that I'm excited about! </sub> <br>

  <sub>*Final paper for Stanford's OSPOXFRD 29: Artificial Intelligence & Society (Fall 2022)* <br>
  The doomsday ending that humans will be demolished in the fierce intelligence competition with AI systems, while remarkably enduring, is a narrow view that distracts us from active measures that can be taken in the present day. I assert that a key tenet of AI development going forward should be keeping humans in the loop,, and evalute three technical research areas facilitating human-in-the-loop AI development and deployment. Distinguishing between non-immediate decision making (e.g., data analytics and robotics) and time-sensitive, safety-critical decision making (e.g., autonomous vehicles and aircraft) is key to understanding how to best facilitate human-AI collaboration in each case.</sub> <br>
