Hello! I am a third-year undergraduate student at Stanford University (Class of 2024), pursuing a B.S. in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a minor in Mathematics and an intended coterminal M.S. in Computer Science.

My research interests span reinforcement learning, robotics, and interactive learning. Through my current coursework and research, I aim to better understand human cognitive processes and engineer computational analogs of these processes in AI systems. Some areas of human cognition that I hope to explore through a computational lens are multimodal perception, interactive learning, and curiosity. 

More broadly, I'm interested in *embodied intelligent systems capable of learning quickly and flexibly by cooperating with humans*. I am excited by the interplay between autonomous and interactive reinforcement learning: a robot should ideally operate and learn autonomously, but query a human operator upon recognizing it has reached an irreversible or unsafe state. By processing human information and feedback, potentially from multiple modalities (language, images, physical repositioning etc.), the robot can then proceed with its assigned tasks.

I conduct research with Stanford's [IRIS Lab](https://irislab.stanford.edu/) which studies intelligence through robotic interaction at scale, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://ml.stanford.edu/index.html). I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and [Suraj Nair](https://cs.stanford.edu/~surajn/).

Besides research, I also have experience as a software engineer at Salesforce, and working in startups, ranging from deep tech (quantum computing) to B2C companies, based in Southeast Asia and the United States. Currently, I am studying abroad at the University of Oxford in Fall 2022, taking classes in graph representation learning and philosophy of mind.

I am a U.S. citizen who grew up and was educated in Singapore. Outside of class and research, I enjoy playing tennis, hiking, reading (+ occasionally writing) science fiction, and brush calligraphy.

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach me at oliviayl [at] stanford [dot] edu.
