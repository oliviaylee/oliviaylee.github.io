Hello! I am a third-year undergraduate student at Stanford University (Class of 2024), pursuing a B.S. in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with a minor in Mathematics and an M.S. in Computer Science.

My research interests span reinforcement learning, robotics, and interactive learning. Broadly, I aim to better understanding human cognitive processes and engineering computational analogs of these processes in AI systems. Some cognitive processes that I hope to explore through a computational lens are multimodal perception, interactive learning, and curiosity.

I conduct research with Stanford's [IRIS Lab](https://irislab.stanford.edu/) which studies intelligence through robotic interaction at scale, affiliated with the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/) and [Stanford Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://ml.stanford.edu/index.html). I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and [Suraj Nair](https://cs.stanford.edu/~surajn/).

Besides research, I also have experience working in startups, ranging from deep tech (quantum computing) to B2C companies, based in Southeast Asia and the United States. Currently, I am working as as software engineer at Salesforce, and will be studying abroad at the University of Oxford in Fall 2022, studying statistical machine learning and philosophy of cognitive science.

I am a U.S. citizen who grew up and was educated in Singapore. Outside of class and research, I enjoy playing tennis, hiking, reading (+ occasionally writing) science fiction, and brush calligraphy.

If any of the above sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you! Feel free to reach me at oliviayl [at] stanford [dot] edu.
